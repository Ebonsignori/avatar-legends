# Creating a Character

You **don't** have to read through all these rules and rule books to create a character if you don't want to. We can do a lot of character creation together in our first session.

In fact, we can even create a different story and plot hook together if you aren't in love with the one I provided in the [introduction](./0-introduction.md).

At a minimum you should at least consider (but don't have to have in stone):
1. Your fighting style:
    - Earth :earth_americas:
    - Fire :fire:
    - Air :cloud:
    - Water :ocean:
    - Weapons :punch: (Chi blockers, Kyoshi warrior, sword master, etc)
    - Technology :zap: (machines, traps, etc) 
2. Your background. Some examples:
    - Military
    - Monastic
    - Outlaw
    - Privileged
    - Urban
    - Wilderness
3. [Your name](https://youtu.be/tZQJhvs4amQ).
4. Your connections! Do you know anyone else in the party or intro sequence? 

    Perhaps you are siblings, friends, partners in crime, etc. If you are an airbender it might make sense for you to know the older man from the intro. Maybe you are a bender from the same temple. Maybe his apprentice?

    If you are a firebender consider that you will need to be slightly rebellious or not accepting of fire nation nationalism. You can be from anywhere and you don't _have_ to have been on the street from the intro. For instance, you could be on one of the arriving ships. Yes, even the fire nation ship! We'll just need to get creative with a story to get you off of it :eyes:

5. Why are you in Port Jinkou. What brought you to the market street?
6. Your playbook!

### [Playbooks](../resources/Playbooks.pdf)

These are sort of like "classes" from DnD or other RPGs. This game is very strong on the *narrative* side of things, so your playbook is heavily tied to your character's background. 

You can read the official rules for character creation in the [Core Book](../resources/Core.pdf) starting on page `112`. All 14 of the playbooks are listed in the [Playbooks](../resources/Playbooks.pdf) resource, but the full narratives behind the first 10 playbooks are found in the [Core Book](../resources/Core.pdf) and the four bonus playbooks (The Destined, The Elder, The Foundling, and The Razor) in the supplemental [Wan Shi Tong Book](../resources/WST.pdf)
