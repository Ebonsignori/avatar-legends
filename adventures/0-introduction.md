# Troubling Tidings from the Sea

![Port Jinkou](./0-assets/map.jpg)

An hour's flight away from Port Jinkou by wing, a school of sparrow salmon gather just below the surface of the ocean to enjoy their afternoon sunning. A few of the smaller fish’s enjoyment is cut short as an oversized sparrow salmon pushes them away, laying claim to a particularly nice spot of sunlight. 

Satisfied with his new spot, the fat salmon stretches his large flipper-wings as the displaced fish are pushed away, dismayed. Their disappointment is immediately forgotten as they watch the large fish get blasted away in a sudden current, as if struck by a fist of water. 

Above them, a ship speeds along the surface. Propelled along by an unnatural current, it moves faster than any ship they’ve seen before. 

Disturbed by a ship that seems to have the power to move the very water itself, the school of fish bursts from the surface, fill their lungs with air, spread their wings, and flee to their nests.

However, the big fish is determined to get the most of his stolen spot, so he remains. He returns to it and basks for a time, but before long another fast moving ship disrupts his relaxation. The last thing he sees before getting sucked into a whirlpool towards the back end of the ship is a hulking dark metallic hull.

The bustling market street of Port Jinkou runs along the coast of the village, ending at the docks. Traveling merchants, towns folks, and farmers from further inland gather on the market street today to share their wares.


You watch as a group of children clap along to a hog monkey dancing to the rhythm of its owner’s drums. A woman is buying cabbages from a cabbage merchant, his son helping her load a basket. A guard standing near the stall looks at ease, like he has never needed to use the spear he carries.

At a clearing towards the end of the road, a middle aged man is creating the foundations of a home. As he lifts his arms in the direction of a nearby wagon, a boulder rises from it and moves towards the clearing, as if guided by his arms. He sets it down and with a horizontal chopping motion of his hands followed by a quick vertical chop the sides of the uneven rock are sliced off, leaving a smooth brick. 

Watching him work is an older man with an easy smile, kind eyes, and the unmistakable bald head and tattoos of an air nomad.

Further down the street at the docks, a new ship has just arrived. It carries news that is about to change everything.

Two women exit the ship. One is hooded, the other is in water tribe garb, and both look absolutely exhausted. As they approach the market, the hooded woman seems to miss a step when she sees the older air nomad. “I’ve changed my mind.” you overhear her say to her companion, “We need to alert everyone. Immediately.” 

“We’ve talked about this , I won’t - “ you miss the rest of the reply as the crack of the earthbender builder cutting another brick fills the air.

The hooded woman practically yells to her companion in reply, “You don’t understand! They won’t stop until they’ve removed every living airbender!”

You quickly realize you aren’t the only one who overheard this. The constant rhythm of the drum suddenly cuts off. The boy helping the cabbage merchant drops the cabbage he was handling. The earthbender builder's rock hangs uncut in mid air. 

Concerned, the elderly air nomad asks in a voice loud enough for all to hear, “Sorry to interrupt, but who would want to harm us?”

At this the hooded woman removes her hood revealing tattoos that are twins of the older man’s and replies, “The fire nation. They’ve completely destroyed our air temples, and they’re on the hunt for any who might have escaped.”

The silence this time is much longer, punctuated only by the cawing of sparrow salmon flying overhead. Abruptly, the woman at the cabbage stand drops her basket of cabbages and points out towards the ocean. “Is that… Is that a fire nation ship?” she asks into the silence. 

“Oh no. That’s them. We’re all in danger!” the water nation woman cries over the simultaneous wails of “My caaaabages!” from the father and son of the cabbage stall.

Faster than you would have thought possible, the busy street is evacuated. People scurry away with their carts, grab their children, and move away from the docks. The guard on duty also disappears, but you hope it’s to get help. 

Because as you look around you notice that not many people remain. There are the two women, the earthbender builder, and the older air bender frozen in shock, disbelief plain on his weathered face. 

Around the market you notice five more people who didn’t flee with the others. Who are they and what will they do? 

For that matter, who are you? 

And what will you do?
