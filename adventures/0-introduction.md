# Troubling Tidings from the Sea

![Port Jinkou](./0-assets/map.jpg)

An hour's flight away from Port Jinkou by wing, a school of sparrow salmon gather just below the surface of the ocean to enjoy their afternoon sunning. A few of the smaller fish’s enjoyment is cut short as an oversized sparrow salmon pushes them away, laying claim to a particularly nice spot of sunlight. 

Satisfied with his new spot, the fat salmon stretches his large flipper-wings as the displaced fish are pushed away, dismayed. Their disappointment is immediately forgotten as they watch the large fish get blasted away in a sudden current, as if struck by a fist of water. 

Above them, a ship speeds along the surface. Propelled along by an unnatural current, it moves faster than any ship they’ve seen before. 

Disturbed by a ship that seems to have the power to move the very water itself, the school of fish bursts from the surface, fill their lungs with air, spread their wings, and flee to their nests.

However, the big fish is determined to get the most of his stolen spot, so he remains. He returns to it and basks for a time, but before long another fast moving ship disrupts his relaxation. The last thing he sees before getting sucked into a whirlpool towards the back end of the ship is a hulking dark metallic hull.

The bustling market street of Port Jinkou runs along the coast of the village, ending at the docks. Traveling merchants, towns folks, and farmers from further inland gather on the market street today to share their wares.


You watch as a group of children clap along to a hog monkey dancing to the rhythm of its owner’s drums. A woman is buying cabbages from a cabbage merchant, his son helping her load a basket. A guard standing near the stall looks at ease, like he has never needed to use the spear he carries.

At a clearing towards the end of the road, a middle aged man is creating the foundations of a home. As he lifts his arms in the direction of a nearby wagon, a boulder rises from it and moves towards the clearing, as if guided by his arms. He sets it down and with a horizontal chopping motion of his hands followed by a quick vertical chop the sides of the uneven rock are sliced off, leaving a smooth brick. 

Watching him work is an older man with an easy smile, kind eyes, and a bald head covered with the unmistakable tattoos of an air nomad.

Further down the street at the docks, a new ship has just arrived. It carries news that is about to change everything.

Two women exit the ship. One is hooded, the other is in water tribe garb, and both look absolutely exhausted. As they approach the market, the hooded woman seems to miss a step when she sees the older air nomad. “I can't...” you overhear her say to her companion, “We need to alert this town. Immediately.” 

“We’ve talked about this , I won’t - “ you miss the rest of the reply as the crack of the earthbender builder cutting another brick fills the air.

The hooded woman practically yells to her companion in reply, “You don’t understand! They won’t stop until they’ve removed every living airbender!”

You quickly realize you aren’t the only one who overheard this. The constant rhythm of the drum suddenly cuts off. The boy helping the cabbage merchant drops the cabbage he is handling. The earthbender builder's rock hangs uncut in mid air. 

Concerned, the elderly air nomad asks in a voice loud enough for all to hear, “Sorry to interrupt, but who would want to harm us?”

In response, the hooded woman removes her hood revealing tattoos that are twins of the older man’s and replies, “The Fire Nation. They attacked our temple, and are on the hunt for any who might have escaped.”

The silence this time is much longer, punctuated only by the cawing of sparrow salmon flying overhead. A boy from the crowd dressed in faded red robes yells, "The Fire Nation would never do that!" A few people mumble in agreement, others back away from the airbender woman and her companion.

While the crowd expresses their disbelief, the guard is distracted by the sparrow salmon passing overhead. They never fly in from the sea this early. He scans the direction the birds came from and sees a plume of smoke jetting out of a ship heading directly towards the town. "That ship is on fire" he yells while pointing towards the fast approaching vessel.

Frantic, the airbender woman removes more of her cloak, revealing fresh burn marks on her right arm. "Please listen! I'm the only nun who escaped the Eastern Air Temple" she points with her seared arm towards the smoking ship, "And that ship isn't on fire. It's one of the new Fire Nation ships that attacked us!"

The woman at the cabbage stand abruptly drops her basket of cabbages which seems to set off a chain reaction of motion in the market. The builder drops his stone with a thud that cuts off the simultaneous wails of "My caaaabages!" from the father and son of the cabbage stall. Carts begin to pack up their wares as people begin to abandon the market faster than you thought possible. 

The guard runs off into the town. You hope it's to get help.

Because you notice that not many people remain in the street. The airbender woman and her water tribe companion try to beckon the older airbender, but he is frozen to the ground, disbelief plain on his weathered face. 

You're not far from them. In fact you notice five others who didn’t flee with the crowd standing nearby. Who are they and what will they do? 

For that matter, who are you? 

And what will you do?
